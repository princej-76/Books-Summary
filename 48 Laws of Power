Law 1: NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER.

No matter how smart you are you have to make them feel that they  are superior.
Just show less qualities from you master to make them feel comfortable.
Your master should feel more brilliant than you.


Law 2: NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, LEARN TO USE ENEMIES.

Friends will betray you more quickly than others as they know many secrets of you.
